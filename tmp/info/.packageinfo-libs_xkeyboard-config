Type: ipkg
Description:    There are many X Window implementations which have very poor support for
non-standard keyboards, national layouts and options.Open Source X Window
System implementations (xfree86, x.org) currently have non-synchronized
XKB configuration databases the bugs fixed in one repository are not reflected
in the other, new configuration elements are added (in best case) separately
and independently to both CVS trees - but usually only one tree gets them. Also,
these implementations contain unbalanced and unstructured layout trees
(very often one country/language have several layouts, each with its own set of variants).
