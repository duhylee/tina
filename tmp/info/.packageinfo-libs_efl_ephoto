Maintainer: Houston <smhouston88@gmail.com>
Source: ephoto-1.5.tar.xz
Type: ipkg
Description: Ephoto is an image viewer and editor written with a focus on simplicity and ease of use
while taking full advantage of EFL's speed and tiny memory footprint.
Browse images via thumbnail, single view with editing features, or display a moving slideshow.
There are neat filters to try, from Gaussian blurs to intricate sketches.
Ephoto is extremely versatile, in that it can act as both a simple viewer and an advanced image editor.
