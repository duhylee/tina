Title: Free Implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm
Maintainer: Behdad Esfahbod <behdad@gnu.org>
Source: fribidi-1.0.1.tar.bz2
License: GPL
Type: ipkg
Description: One of the missing links stopping the penetration of free software in Middle
East is the lack of support for the Arabic and Hebrew alphabets. In order to
have proper Arabic and Hebrew support, the bidi algorithm needs to be implemented. It is
our hope that this library will stimulate more free software in the Middle
Eastern countries.
