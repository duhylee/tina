Maintainer: Boris Faure <billiob@gmail.com>
Source: terminology-1.1.1.tar.xz

Description: Terminology is a terminal emulator bristling with advanced features including

in-line display of media (click on a file path to a video and watch it play),
link detection, compressed scrollback stored in RAM, translucency and
a gorgeous look and feel inspired by classic CRT monitors.
